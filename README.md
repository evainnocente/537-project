# 537-project

Introduction

This project analyses whole genome sequences of Northern Common Eiders _(Somateria mollissima borealis)_ in order to answer the question: Does genetic variation in toll-like receptors (TLRs) contribute to avian cholera resistance?

This project was completed as part of the requirements for completing an Honours Thesis in Biology at Queen's University.
